  // it's the single biggest technical reason this project is Astro and not
  // the same React/Vite stack as the order-landing-page engine.

  // Language type ('fr' | 'ar' | 'en', FR-required/others-optional) but
  // implemented as real, separately-crawlable static pages instead of a
  // client-side toggle — this site's whole architecture is built around
  // being readable by non-JS crawlers (see the `output: 'static'` note
  // above), so a JS-only language switch would quietly undo that for two
